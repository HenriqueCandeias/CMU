# ConversationalIST - Android App


"Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing" MSc course group project. Goal: develop a mobile application using Android Studio.

This non-trivial application explores several key aspects of mobile development, including location awareness, judicious use of limited resources, and social behavior.

Users can create public, private, or even geo-fenced chatrooms and participate in shared conversations while being able to review older chat history, even retroactively prior to joining. Conversations can include a variety of media, such as text or photos. Basic features such as UI adaptability to phone orientation and social sharing of chatrooms are provided. 

In the current implementation, the majority of the application's intended features are fully developed. However, there are some minor bugs in need of squashing.
