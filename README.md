# ConversationalIST

## University project to learn how to develop mobile applications using Android Studio.

This application will explore several key aspects of mobile development, including location awareness, judicious use of limited resources, and social behavior. Towards this end, a simple but powerful messaging App will be developed: ConversationalIST

Users can create public, private or even geo-fenced chatrooms and participate in shared conversations while being able to review older chat history, even retroactively prior to joining. Conversations can include a variety of media, such as text or photos.

Basic features such as UI adaptability to phone orientation and social sharing of chatrooms is provided. 

### In the current implementation, most of the application's features are developed. However, there are some minor bugs in need of squashing.
